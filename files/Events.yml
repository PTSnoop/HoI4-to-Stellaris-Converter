CleanIndustrialization1: "&YEAR&: The &RANDOM_SMALL_CITY& Accords are signed. All world nations agree to leave the rest of the world's remaining fossil fuels entirely untapped."
CleanIndustrialization2: "&DECADE&: Breakthroughs in clean energy technology bring billions of people out of poverty, while keeping the rise in global temperatures within 2°C."
ColdWar0: "&YEAR&: Several serious breakdowns in relations between &NATION_1& and &NATION_2& mark the beginning of the 'Cold War' between the two superpowers."
ColdWar1: "&YEAR&: Multiple nuclear tests carried out by both &NATION_1& and &NATION_2&, exacerbating the nuclear arms race between the two."
ColdWar2: "&YEAR&: Through economic aid schemes, rigged elections, and military coups, almost every country is now clearly under the sphere of influence of either &NATION_1& or &NATION_2&."
DefconColdWar0: "&DECADE&: Widespread nuclear proliferation. More and more nations seek to establish their own 'nuclear deterrant'."
DefconColdWar1: "&DECADE&: Worldwide breakdown in international relations. Reasoned diplomacy is increasingly replaced with brinkmanship and threats of nuclear obliteration."
DefconNuclearWar: "&YEAR&: A diplomatic crisis in &RANDOM_SMALL_NATION& triggers Nuclear War. &DEFCONRESULTS&"
DefconSurvive1: "&NATION_1& survives mostly unscathed, with no significant loss of life."
DefconSurvive2: "&NATION_1&, too, manages to avoid heavy losses."
DefconSurvive3: "&NATION_1& manages to avoid the attention of any other powers' nuclear arsenal, and remains mostly intact."
DefconOk1: "&NATION_1& loses several major cities, but is able to reestablish civilian government and distribute aid to survivors without significant delay."
DefconOk2: "&NATION_1& is severely weakened, and spends the next decade gradually rebuilding its infrastructure and industrial capacity."
DefconObliterated1: "&NATION_1& is almost completely obliterated."
DefconObliteratedPl1: "&NATION_1& are almost completely obliterated."
DefconNuclearWar1: "&DECADE&: Winds scatter radioactive fallout across every nation on Earth. Global health crisis."
DefconNuclearWar2: "&DECADE&: The survivors of the Nuclear War begin to reestablish themselves. New cities are built in less-irradiated rural areas and underground bunker networks."
ColdWarStaysCold: "&YEAR&: Détente between the two global superpowers. Both nations agree to some degree of nuclear disarmament."
EconomicProblems0: "&YEAR&: Worldwide economic crisis. &NATION_1& is particularly badly affected, forcing them to abandon all overseas territories and adopt a strongly isolationist foreign policy."
EconomicCollapse0: "&YEAR&: &NATION_1& suffers a near-complete economic collapse, forcing a complete change of government and loss of much of its former territory."
GlobalWarming: "&DECADE&: After decades of overexploitation, global warming and climate change, the global biosphere begins to collapse. Desertification and mass extinctions render most of the Earth's surface an arid wasteland."
GovernmentClimateControl: "&YEAR&: &NATION_1& takes drastic action against climate change, funding massive environmental reconstruction projects and banning the use of fossil fuels throughout most of the world. These measures, while expensive, successfully keep global temperature rises within 2°C."
Hegemon: "&YEAR&: The last few independent nations are brought into the World Economic Union, with free movement of people and one single world currency. &NATION_1& now holds de facto control over the planet, and stands alone as the world's sole superpower."
MinorNuclearWar: "&YEAR&: A diplomatic crisis in &RANDOM_SMALL_NATION& triggers Nuclear War between &NATION_1& and &NATION_2&. &NATION_1& is able to overwhelm &NATION_2&'s defences, while shooting down the majority of the &NATION_2_ADJ& missiles. &NATION_1& leaves the war comparatively unscathed; &NATION_2& is mostly obliterated."
MinorNuclearWarLose: "&YEAR&: The Nuclear War may be over, but &NATION_1& is proving notoriously difficult to occupy. Partisans continue to hold out against invasion."
MinorNuclearWarWin: "&YEAR&: &NATION_1& officially withdraws from the radioactive wasteland."
NuclearIndustrialDesert: "&DECADE&: Decades of overexploitation and global warming have left their mark on the Earth's ecosystem. But the ecological damage from the Nuclear War pushes the biosphere over the edge into complete collapse. Mass exctinction of plant life turns most of the Earth's surface into desert."
NuclearWar: "&YEAR&: A diplomatic crisis in &RANDOM_SMALL_NATION& triggers Nuclear War between &NATION_1& and &NATION_2&. Both nations are almost completely obliterated."
NuclearWarLose: "&YEAR&: Some semblance of government is restored among the irradiated ashes of the former &NATION_1& and &NATION_2&."
NuclearWinter: "&DECADE&: Global temperatures continue to plummet, as the dust and soot from the Nuclear War block out the sun's rays. The nuclear winter causes the polar ice caps to grow, reflecting more and more sunlight into space. The Earth enters a New Ice Age."
SeaLevelsRise: "&DECADE&: Global temperatures continue to increase, causing the polar ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise. Most of the Earth is now under water."
Squabbling: "&DECADE&: The Earth remains divided. No single government has managed to establish control over the planet. Tired of the increasingly-overbearing bureaucratic control of the United Nations, several nations begin to look outwards towards the stars."
OldSquabbling: "&DECADE&: Globalization continues to increase and national borders become increasingly porous. The concept of the individual nation state begins to slip into irrelevance."
TombWorld: "&DECADE&: The ecological damage from the Nuclear War pushes the biosphere over the edge into complete collapse. Irradiated water supplies and subsequent mass exctinctions render most of the Earth's surface uninhabitable."
Migrations: "&DECADE&: Economic and climate pressures, combined with widespread high-speed transport technology, lead to mass migrations all over the world. The idea that a racial or ethnic group should correspond to one geographical area is seen as laughably outdated."
Launches: "&YEAR&: The first Great Ark Ship is launched. Over the next decade, each of the major nations of the Earth will launch Ark Ships to promising-looking exoplanets, in the hope of spreading their influence throughout the galaxy."
EscapeLaunches: "&YEAR&: The first Great Ark Ship is launched. Over the next decade, each of the major nations of the Earth will launch Ark Ships to promising-looking exoplanets, in the hope of finding a more habitable planet to live on."
